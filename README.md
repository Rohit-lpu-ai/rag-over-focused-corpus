## 📖 Project Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based Question Answering system over a focused collection of documents.

The system allows users to upload and query documents in natural language and receive context-aware answers generated using Large Language Models (LLMs) and semantic search.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional LLMs suffer from hallucination and lack access to domain-specific knowledge.

This project solves this problem by:

* Retrieving relevant information from a focused corpus.
* Providing grounded answers based on retrieved context.
* Displaying source citations for transparency.

---

## 🚀 Features

* PDF document ingestion
* Automatic text extraction
* Intelligent chunking strategy
* Semantic search using embeddings
* Vector database storage
* Context-aware answer generation
* Source citation support
* User-friendly interface
* Evaluation pipeline

# Week 2 Learning Summary

- Learned the fundamentals of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Explored PDF parsing and document ingestion using PyPDF.
- Implemented text chunking using LangChain text splitters.
- Generated semantic embeddings using the BGE embedding model.
- Learned the difference between keyword search and semantic search.
- Gained hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, and Jupyter notebooks.
- Successfully processed documents into 103 chunks with 384-dimensional embeddings.
- Adopted a modular notebook-based workflow for building the RAG pipeline.

## Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Data Source

The project uses a focused corpus of documents for retrieval and question answering.

Corpus:

* To be finalized.

---

## Example Questions

* What are the deliverables for Week 2?
* What is the late submission policy?
* How many ADRs are required?
* What are the requirements for Milestone 1?

---

## Evaluation

The system will be evaluated using:

* Retrieval accuracy
* Answer relevance
* Context precision
* Context recall
* Faithfulness

---

## Mini Extension

Planned extension:

* Multi-document comparison support
* Comparative answers across multiple PDFs

---

## Tests

Run tests using:

```bash
pytest
```

---

## Known Limitations

* Supports English documents only.
* Performance may decrease for extremely large corpora.
* Currently optimized for PDF documents.

---

## Future Work

* Hybrid search (BM25 + Dense Retrieval)
* Re-ranking
* Multi-modal support
* Agentic workflows

---

## ADRs

Architecture Decision Records are stored in:

```text
docs/adr/
```

---

## 3rd Year Extension Plan

This project will be extended in third year by:

* Adding enterprise-scale document ingestion
* Supporting multiple data sources
* Adding fine-tuning
* Introducing agentic retrieval pipelines
